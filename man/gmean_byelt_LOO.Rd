\title{Geometric mean
 by elements occurring within assembly motif
 using leave-one-out method}
\usage{
gmean_byelt_LOO(fobs, mOccur)
}
\arguments{
\item{fobs}{a numeric vector. The vector \code{fobs} contains the
quantitative performances of assemblages.}

\item{mOccur}{a matrix of occurrence (occurrence of elements).
Its first dimension equals to \code{length(fobs)}. Its second dimension
 equals to the number of elements.}
}
\value{
Return a vector of \code{length(fobs)}.
Its values are computed as the average
of mean performances of all assemblages
that contain the same elements
as the assemblage to predict (\code{opt.model = "byelt"}) .
}
\description{
Take a vector \code{fobs}
of performances of assemblages
that share a same assembly motif,
and return a vector of performances
predicted as the arithmetic mean
of performances of assemblages
that contain the same elements as the assemblage to predict.\cr

All assemblages share the same assembly motif.
}
\details{
Predicted performances are computed
using geometric mean (\code{opt.mean = "gmean"})
of performances.
Assemblages share a same assembly motif (\code{opt.model = "bymot"}).
Predicted performances are the average
of mean performances of assemblages
that contain the same elements
as the assemblage to predict,
except the assemblage to predict.
This procedure corresponds to a linear model with each assembly motif
based on the element occurrence in each assemblage.
