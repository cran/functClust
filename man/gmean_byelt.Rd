\title{Geometric mean
 by components occurring within an assembly motif}
\usage{
gmean_byelt(fobs, mOccur)
}
\arguments{
\item{fobs}{a numeric vector. The vector \code{fobs} contains the
quantitative performances of assemblages.}

\item{mOccur}{a matrix of occurrence (occurrence of components).
Its first dimension equals to \code{length(fobs)}. Its second dimension
 equals to the number of components.}
}
\value{
Return a vector of \code{length(fobs)}.
Its values are computed as the average
of mean performances of assemblages that contain the same components
as the assemblage to calibrate (\code{opt.model = "byelt"}) .
}
\description{
Take a vector \code{fobs}
of performances of assemblages
that share a same assembly motif,
and return a vector of performances
predicted as the geometric mean
of performances of assemblages
that contain the same components as the assemblage to predict. \cr

All assemblages share the same assembly motif.
}
\details{
Modelled performances are computed
using geometric mean (\code{opt.mean = "gmean"}) of performances.
Assemblages share a same assembly motif.
Modelled performances are the average
of mean performances of assemblages that contain the same components
as the assemblage to calibrate (\code{opt.model = "byelt"}).
This procedure corresponds to a linear model with each assembly motif
based on the component occurrence in each assemblage.
