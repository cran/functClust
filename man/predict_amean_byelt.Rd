\usage{
predict_amean_byelt(appFct, appMotifs, appOccur,
                        supMotifs, supOccur )
}
\arguments{
\item{appFct}{a vector of numeric values (assembly properties).}

\item{appMotifs}{a vector of labels of \code{length(fct)} (assembly motifs).}

\item{appOccur}{a matrix of occurrence (occurrence of components).
Its first dimension equals to \code{length(fct)}. Its second dimension
 equals to the number of components.}

\item{supMotifs}{a vector of labels of \code{length(fct)} (assembly motifs).}

\item{supOccur}{a matrix of occurrence (occurrence of components).
Its first dimension equals to \code{length(fct)}. Its second dimension
 equals to the number of components.}
