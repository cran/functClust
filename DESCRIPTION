Description: Cluster together the components that make up an interactive
 system on the basis of their functional redundancy 
 for one or more collective, systemic performances. 
 Plot the hierarchical tree of component clusters,
 the modelled and predicted performances of component assemblages,
 and other results associated with a functional clustering.
 Test and prioritize the significance of the different components 
 that make up the interactive system, 
 of the different assemblages of components that make up the dataset, 
 and of the different performances observed on the component assemblages.
 The method finds application in ecology, for instance,
 where the system is an ecosystem, the components are organisms or species,
 and the systemic performance is the production of biomass 
 or the respiration of the ecosystem. 
 The method is extensively described in
